## ðŸ§  Development Decisions

- **Animations**: Used React Native Animated API for smooth transitions and visual feedback
- **TypeScript**: Implemented full TypeScript support for better development experience and code reliability
- **Component Architecture**: Created reusable components to maintain a clean and modular codebase
- **Theme System**: Implemented a theme context to support dark/light mode and consistent styling
- **Testing**: Added basic tests to ensure task management functionality works correctly

## ðŸ”„ Future Improvements

- Add task searching capability
- Implement task grouping and sorting options
- Add recurring tasks functionality
- Create statistics dashboard for task completion
- Add cloud sync capability for multi-device support
- Expand test coverage
